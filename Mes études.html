                            <p>First, my name is MARCUZZI Swann I am
                                 born September 25, 2003 in Mulhouse. I am passionate
                                 new technologies and the world of the Internet in
                                general since the day my mother bought me a DS in
                                the age of 9 years. Later I learned to use a
                                the computer. I had a lot of questions about the
                                PC operation, so I watch a lot of video
                                on Youtube, that's how I learned a lot.

                                <br>
                                I then built my own PC and subsequently I
                                 I was building for my relatives, my friends in order to have a few euros.
                                 I loved it but I found that I was missing a lot of
                                knowledge to explore.

            <h5>my studies</h5>
                <p>To start from my primary to college, I studied in a private
                college "Sainte Ursule College" I have very good memories.
                 After my third year, I went to second general at "Le Montaigne"
                 high school where I quickly realized that what I was missing were
                   practical lessons. So I went to STI2D at "Louis Armand" high 
                   school and liked it very much. We had several projects that
                 allowed me to deepen my knowledge. In my senior year of high
                  school, I had a lot of questions about my orientation and after
                   hearing about RT BUT, I thought this was what I was looking for.

            <h5>BUT RT </h5>
            <p>
                THE NETWORKS & TELECOMS B.U.T is a National Diploma at BAC
                +3 level offered and issued by the IUTs.
                It trains the digital technology specialists of tomorrow. 
                It is a professional training recognized and appreciated by
                companies allowing rapid professional integration in a booming 
                business sector. Continuation of studies in Engineering Schools or 
                Masters is possible at the end of the second year or after obtaining the BUT.

                The main areas studied are:
                Computer networks (administration and security of systems and infrastructures)
                Web and Internet technologies
                Wireless and wired communications
                Computer programming
                Transversal tools (Mathematics, Electronics, Expression/Communication,
                Professional English, IT and Internet Law)
                 <br>
                 <br>
                After spending 3 months in RT here is my feeling. I'm rather surprised
                at the speed at which we learn, I think I learned more in 3 months of RT
                than in all of my 2 years in STI2D. I also notice that I have a considerable
                delay compared to the rest of the class especially in English in maths but 
                also in network administration. However, I like what we are learning and I
                think I will invest a lot more to be able to continue. I plan to continue
                with the ROM or Cyber course next year on a work-study basis. I can't wait
                to discover the world of work.
